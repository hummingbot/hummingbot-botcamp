    1) This class should not be a ScriptStrategyBase but because I don't want to mess with the codebase too much,
       I am placing the logic on how the AI helper works here for a single file submission and so other people
       can see how it works

    2) Ideally this class should be somewhere in the client folder

    3) For the custom 'ai' command to work, I have modified the silly_commands.py and added 'ai' as a command
       Ideally the file should be ai_helper_command.py and should be integrating into the hummingbot_application.py

        {"role": "system", "content": "Sure, let me explain:\n\n1. MACD, or Moving Average Convergence Divergence, is a trend-following momentum indicator. It shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.\n\n2. RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It is used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market. The RSI calculates average price gains and losses over a given period of time; the default time period is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100.\n\nBoth of these indicators are commonly used in technical analysis to generate trading signals based on their values."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "can we mix this two TA together for a strategy?"},
        {"role": "system", "content": "Absolutely! Combining MACD and RSI can provide a more robust trading strategy. \n\nThe MACD can be used to identify potential buy and sell points with its signal line crossovers. Meanwhile, the RSI can add an additional layer of validation to these signals by identifying whether the asset is in an overbought or oversold condition.\n\nFor example, a strategy could be to buy when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (bullish crossover) and the RSI is below 30 (oversold condition), indicating a potential increase in price. Conversely, a sell signal could be when the MACD line crosses below the signal line (bearish crossover) and the RSI is above 70 (overbought condition), indicating a potential decrease in price.\n\nCould you please describe how you'd like to use these two indicators in your strategy? This will help me generate the strategy script."},

        {"role": "system", "content": "That's a good start. To clarify, you're suggesting a buy signal when the RSI is near or in the overbought territory (usually considered to be an RSI value over 70) and the MACD line crosses above the signal line. Conversely, a sell signal would occur when the RSI is near or in the oversold territory (usually considered to be an RSI value under 30) and the MACD line crosses below the signal line.\n\nIs that correct? If so, this information will be very helpful for generating the strategy script. However, it would be great if you could give your strategy a name now. It should be a single word without spaces, like 'macd_rsi_strategy'."},
